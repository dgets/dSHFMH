# dEMDR-c

I had originally started on a Java project to experiment with EMDR technology
not long ago.  I'd attempted to use a Slider object, however, and I guess this
widget is too complex to, or just decides not to, update on the display if the
value is changed more than every ~20-25ms or so.  Unfortunately, this makes it
unviable for the variable rate 'Knight Rider/Kitt' display that we need for
this therapy to work.

This project is implemented using javafx's Canvas objects, and seems to be
much more responsive, as well as allowing much more flexibility in display
options.  I don't think it's going to take much to get this project somewhat
useful, though adding features such as the tactile stim devices (especially if
utilizing _bluetooth_ connections) will provide added challenge, at some
point.
