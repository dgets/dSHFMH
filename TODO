It really sucks having to use a text file for this stuff when I'm used to
using GitHub & GitLab with their issues tracking features.  :(  I hope I can
afford internet again soon.

* reimplement OO structure for more sanity (or, barring that...)
* learn & implement junit testing
* set the display to pause when the user preferences window comes up
* start utilizing task manager in eclipse until net access is back

* switch to utilizing 3 integers (min, max, & cur) in the saved data for the
  default Color objects as one each of RGB; this will save us from having to
  complicate the data structure further right now, though that's what I'm sure
  we'll end up having to do for best maintainability purposes

Completed or Void

* [previously below reimplement OO structure for more sanity]
  * move UserPrefs to be a subclass of DisplayArray, or at least put them all
    into a superclass to keep shit together that is causing issues now with
    the fact that I can't instantiate UserPrefs.ControlGrid to access the
    ControlGrid child class (due to the fact that there's already a UserPrefs
    active with a GUI and all (see error in Options.UserSet.initStructs() when
    trying to declare 'nakk' as a UserPrefs.ControlGrid in order to fill a
    temporary record to then stuff into the data struct
  * it's probably not the best for programmer sanity, but it could also be
    possible to stuff the array directly, though I'm not sure how (JSON-ish?)
* do a code scrub; take out unused variables & cruft from implementations that
  have rendered previous shit irrelevant
